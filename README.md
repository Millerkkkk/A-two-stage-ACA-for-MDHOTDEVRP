* c102_21.txt corresponding to (i) Test Set C102 of fig.3 in the paper.
* function_new.py is a function used in EVRP. 
* First_stage_new.py is the code for the first stage, which aims to cluster customers. 
* Second_stage_new.py is the code for the second stage, designed to apply the ant colony algorithm to each clustered class to find the optimal path.
